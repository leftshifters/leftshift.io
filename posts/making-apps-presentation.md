Here is a presentation I gave at the App Development and Marketing Master Class at [The Coalition](http://thecoalition.in/) in March 2014.

The presentation aims to help you figure out how to decide what to build, finalize a feature set, hire design and development teams and taking your app to the store.

#### 1. Most probably you don't need an app

#### 2. Decide what to build

- Create a long list of ideas
- Keep your mind open
- Exercise your idea muscle
- Let your ideas have sex

#### 3. Is the app worth making?

- Will you use it all the time?
- Are there other people doing the same thing?
- Researched the top 300 people in your category?
- Can you get x signups on your landing page?
- Can you find enough beta testers who care?

#### 4. Do one thing well

- Make a list of features that you want
- Order features by priority
- Remove the bottom half of the feature list
- Keep removing features till it hurts

#### 5. Timelines?

- Wireframes and Design take between 2-3 months
- Development takes between 4 to 26 weeks
- Testing & QA takes 40% of the development time
- Polishing takes 60% of the development time
- Go Live takes about 2 weeks
- Priority Support is required for about 4-6 weeks

#### 6. Get Started

- Decide metrics for happiness
- Create a landing page and start talking to clients
- Hire a team to do wireframes only
- Wireframes are visual documentation
- Wireframe everything including errors (use Sketch)
- Don’t get estimates till you freeze wireframes
- Don’t make a free app, make money

#### 7. Making Money

- Free Apps
- Free Apps with In App Purchase
- Paid Apps
- Paid Apps with In App Purchase
- Consumable Purchases
- Non Consumable Purchases
- Subscriptions
- Ads

#### 8. Design Pays

- Great design pays for itself
- Compete with the best apps
- Pick designers who know the medium
- Where to find designers

#### 9. Handling Developers

- Get a feel for the quality
- Involve developers early. Really early if possible.
- Complete APIs before the app needs it
- Explain functionality in videos not calls
- Get on a call at least twice a week
- Communicate frequently, use the test build. Be engaged.
- Give them time to do things right
- Know what will break.

#### 10. Testing & QA

- Software is never perfect
- Automated vs Manual (auto is 30% more)
- Use a bug tracking tool (we use github)
- Try as many devices as you can (hint 1000s)
- Get as many beta testers as you can
- Pitch to your beta testers

#### 11. Go back to the drawing board

- Third time's a charm

#### 12. How much does it cost?

- Usually between three and fifty lakhs ($60,000 - $100,000)

#### 13. It’s a Long Way to the Top, If You Wanna Rock ’n’ Roll - AC/DC
