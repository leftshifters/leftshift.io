It has been a while since we moved to using the [Sketch App](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) for all our designs. If you're on a Mac, its one of the best tools out there, and the number of designers who are using it keeps increasing at an exponential rate.

We have always wanted to share some of graphics and designs that we were building with Sketch, and here is the first in the series.

You can download the [Sketch files here](https://www.instamojo.com/leftshift/free-download-sketch-files-for-macaw/).
