This is a ready reckoner for our rules, policies and some of the things that might need to know if you are working at Leftshift.

### Trust

1. Everything here works on _trust_.

2. Be it taking a book from the library, working from home, or taking some hardware home, you are free to do whatever makes you _most productive_, as long as it does not bother those around you.

3. We assume you are here to _make lovable apps_. If you are getting held back by anything or have suggestions for improvements, please meet up with Sudhanshu, and tell him. (_He can usually fix things_)

4. As Uncle Ben said, _“With great power comes great responsibility.”_ While you are here, please use _your best judgement_.

### Flexible Working Hours

1. Some of us start work at 9am, and some start as late as 1pm. You are free to choose your own working hours.

2. We don’t keep a track of how many hours you spent in office. We keep track of the work that you are doing. As long as the work is great, it’s all good.

3. If you have stuff to do at home, you can come in early or leave late to avoid taking a half day off (_as long as work does not suffer_)

4. If you get to office after 1pm, please order a pizza.

5. There is no fixed number of hours that you need to spend in office. On some days 4 is more than enough, and on some even 12 isn’t enough.

### Leave and Work From Home Policy

1. We do not have a leave approval process. When you want to go on leave, you just need to _inform_ your team that you will be on leave, and post it on #public-leaves on slack.

2. Since the decision about when to take a leave rests on you, please plan your leaves in a way that everyone on the project is not on leave at the same time.

3. Everybody gets _20 paid leaves_ in one financial year.

4. The leaves are calculated on a _pro-rata_ basis. So if you join on the 1st of October, you get 10 days of leave. (If you get a weird number, just round it to the closest half day)

5. When you _resign_, leaves will again be calculated on a pro-rata basis. If you have used more than you have earned till then, they would be adjusted in your final settlement.

6. For leave with pay, _weekends and holidays_ are _not_ counted.

7. For leave without pay, _weekends and holidays_ are counted. So if you take two months off, you will not be paid for weekends.

8. Leaves should ideally be _planned_ in advance, so that the work schedule doesn't suffer.

9. Leaves will _not be carried forward_ to the next year. So make sure you pack your bags and go somewhere (Or just watch TV at home, that works too). We work hard as it is, taking some days off is always refreshing.

10. All ladies would also be entitled to a paid _maternity leave_ of 90 days, which would include weekends and holidays.

11. All ladies would also be entitled to a paid _maternity leave_ of 21 days if they _legally adopt_ a child (this too would include weekends and holidays).

12. All men would be entitled to 3 days of paid _paternity leave_.

13. Everybody is entitled to 1/2 a day of _leave for voting_ and other civic duties.

14. Everybody is entitled to a _compensatory off_ if they were pre-approved to work full time on a weekend or holiday. (Rule of thumb, you would know before hand if you get a comp off for a certain day or not)

15. Everybody is entitled to _work from home_, if it is pre-planned and your work schedule has been defined. (Though we would love to see you in office)

16. If you are _absent_ without requesting for leave, it would be counted as leave without pay.

### Filing for Refunds for Official Trips

1. When you pay for something, please make sure you keep the _physical bill_. If you get a _soft copy_ of the bill, that would work as well.

2. When you are back in office (_or anywhere for that matter_), head over to https://sheets.google.com and create a list of all your expenses, and break them under the following headings - Travel, Lodging, Food.

3. A sample refund sheet is given [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rxrx8gDOx4SXCpog4ajDsGnTHxoCLquVANdZCids6F0/edit).

4. When you’re done, you can share the sheet with hr@leftshift.

### Using the Library

1. All our books can be found in the shelf, or generally around in office.

2. If you would like to rent out a book, just pick it up and go.

3. At least for now, you do not need to mark anywhere. All that we ask for is give it back when you’re done reading it.

4. All our books have a stamp on the first page or the last page of the book. If you find one at home which is tagged with the office stamp and you’re not reading it, please bring it back.

5. If you lose a book, please let us know at hr@leftshift

6. If you would like us to buy a new book, please drop us an email at hr@leftshift . We do not promise that we will get it immediately, but we will try our best.

### Borrowing office hardware

1. If you would like to borrow a monitor or machine or a phone for use at home for sometime, please feel free to do so.

2. It would be great if you could send an email to hr@leftshift to let them know that you’re taking something home.

### Salary Loans

1. We do generally give out salary loans.

2. If you would like to apply for one, please get in touch with hr@leftshift and we will try our best to give you one as soon as possible.

3. All employee loans are at 0% interest, so if you’re falling short of money for a purchase, this might be a better option than applying for a personal loan.

### Medical Insurance

1. As of this time, the company does not get medical insurance for employees. If this changes in the future, we will certainly let you know.

### Weekly Standups

1. We conduct weekly standups where everybody gets a chance to talk about something new that they have learnt.

2. We loop through every person in the company in a specific order so that everyone gets a chance to speak.

3. Most talks are divided into platform groups like iOS, Android, Web and Design. However, you can attend anyone that you like.

4. Once you join the company, you will be assigned a week, sometime in the future, and you can pick up a date in that particular week and find a topic that you would like to speak on.

5. The details of the next set of talks is given in the following [document](https://docs.google.com/a/leftshift.io/spreadsheets/d/10DzJXEw9-baoovJ13_v1H5hVivTV3TZiHZv8Gv9u0zc/edit?usp=sharing) - If you have a leftshift.io email address, you should be able to view it.

6. You would also find an archive and slides of the older talks in there.

7. You would get an email every Monday which gives you more details of the upcoming talks.

8. If there is no topic assigned to you in the 'Next Up' section, please reach out to sudhanshu with the details about your topic and the date you will be speaking on.

9. If you would like someone to talk about a specific topic, you can let sudhanshu know and he will add it to the Topics Available section.

10. When you submit your presentation, please make sure you add [citations](http://www.plagiarism.org/citing-sources/whats-a-citation)
